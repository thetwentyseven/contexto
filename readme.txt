'It's impossible to understand the nuances of the world without some contextual clues' -Contexto. Contexto works with [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) and [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) to add extra information to your post and pages. While creating or editing a new post or page, just highlight the word, or words desire with your mouse and click the button "Contexto me!" The plugin will do the rest! If Contexto find the word you selected, it will add a picture of the word if it is available, a small description, and a [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) link.


== Description ==

'It's impossible to understand the nuances of the world without some contextual clues' -Contexto.

Contexto is a TinyMCE plugin that works with [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) and [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) APIs.

It adds images, description and links to help you to enrich your content. While creating or editing a post or page, select the words that you want to give some 'context', click the button and Contexto will find and add the extra information for you.

Visitors will hover with their mouse to those words you selected in the text, and they will see the descriptions, images and Wikidata links, that would enrich your content.

Contexto would give your users extra information to understand your content, without leaving your page to find the meaning of those words.

Currently [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) has 46,091,721 items. Contexto can find people, places, brands, and anything that Wikidata has registered. If you cannnot find an item, just register to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) and contribute to the best database in the world.

You MUST register to [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) to make this plugin works. It is free to register and includes 500 requests per day.

You do not need to register to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). However, feel free to register and contribute to the project.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I select more than one word? =

Yes you can. However, it might be possible that Contexto find words that you do not want to publish. For that reason, we recommend to select a word per click.

= What is confidence? =

The confidence is the level of what [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) thinks is correct as a valid entity. [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) uses an ever increasing number of signals to help spot valid entities, all of which contribute to this score. In the admin panel you can select the level of minimum confidence to [TextRazor](https://www.textrazor.com/) to find words. The score ranges from 1 to 10, with 10 representing the highest confidence that this is a valid entity.

= Can I change the box colours? =

Yes you can. Contexto has clear structure so you can modify easily the colours.
